      <description>PySketcher is little library which I maintain which makes it simple (hopefully) to draw geometric images. It was originally written by Hans Petter Langtangen, who sadly passed away in 2016, and since 2019 I&amp;rsquo;ve been keeping it up to date and adding features.
Right now, PySketcher only supports absolute positioning of shapes. This means that you have to know exactly where you&amp;rsquo;d like the center of your circle to be and exactly what radius it should have.</description>

      <description>The is a marvelous article which explains how to use Hugo and MathJax in close harmony. Unfortunately it was written a while ago and only works for MathJax 2.x. This article updates the content of the original to MathJax &amp;gt; 3.1. The original is still worth reading as it nicely explains the functionality.
Firstly MathJax &amp;gt; 3.0 likes to have pollyfill. So the script inclusion should look like this:
1 2  &amp;lt;script src=&amp;#34;https://polyfill.</description>

      <description>Solving it If found myself with a rather strange git problem. As far as I was aware, I was tracking a remote, however when ever I git a git pull, my bash prompt would show me as having commits outstanding.
[voddenr:~/repository] master(4)+i Â± Looking at the commit tree, it would seem that origin/HEAD and origin/master have not been correctly updated:
* f786359 - (HEAD -&amp;gt; master) Merge everything together. (3 hours ago) &amp;lt;Richard Vodden&amp;gt; | * 51955ca - Wrote some code.</description>
