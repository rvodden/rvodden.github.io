<p>If found myself with a rather strange git problem. As far as I was aware,
I was tracking a remote, however when ever I git a <code>git pull</code>, my bash
prompt would show me as having commits outstanding.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>[voddenr:~/repository] master(4)+i ± 
</code></pre><p>Looking at the commit tree, it would seem that <code>origin/HEAD</code> and
<code>origin/master</code> have not been correctly updated:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>*   f786359 - (HEAD -&gt; master) Merge everything together. (3 hours ago) &lt;Richard Vodden&gt;
|
*   51955ca - Wrote some code. (4 hours ago) &lt;Richard Vodden&gt;
|\
| |
| * 81e4c19 - Update readme. (4 hours ago) &lt;Richard Vodden&gt;
| |
| * a84e10e - wip (15 hours ago) &lt;Richard Vodden&gt;
|/
|
*   2dcce03 - (origin/master, origin/HEAD) Some kind of merge message. (24 hours ago) &lt;Richard Vodden&gt;
|\
| |
| * f1622f9 - This is quite a boring message. (24 hours ago) &lt;Richard Vodden&gt;

| |
| * 19756aa - Exciting commit message (25 hours ago) &lt;Richard Vodden&gt; 
</code></pre><p>Executing <code>git remote -vv show origin</code> suggests all is as it should be:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>* remote origin
  Fetch URL: https://github.com/paulgibbs/behat-wordpress-extension
  Push  URL: https://github.com/paulgibbs/behat-wordpress-extension
  HEAD branch: master
  Local branches configured for 'git pull':
    master merges with remote master
  Local ref configured for 'git push': 
    master pushes to master (up to date) 
</code></pre><p>However <code>git branch -a -vv</code> show&rsquo;s something amiss:</p>
<p><code>git remote -a -v -v</code> shows:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>* master                           ef786359 Merge everything together
  remotes/origin/HEAD              -&gt; origin/master
</code></pre><p>This should show <code>[origin/master]</code> after the commit hash - which it
clearly doesn&rsquo;t. So whilst my master branch is set to push and pull to the
right places, its not correctly set to track <code>origin/master</code>. However when
I attempt to execute <code>git branch --set-upstream-to origin master</code> to fix
that, Git replies with <code>fatal: Cannot setup tracking information; starting point 'origin/master' is not a branch.</code></p>
<p>A quick google of that error message reveals
<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22446446/cannot-setup-tracking-information-starting-point-origin-master-is-not-a-branch">this stackoverflow
answer</a>.
It would seem that <code>git remote set-branches --add origin master</code> is the answer here. After
executing it, <code>git remote -a -v -v</code> shows things are as they should be:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>* master                 eef78635 [origin/master] Merge everything together
  remotes/origin/HEAD    -&gt; origin/master
</code></pre><p>Similarly, <code>git remote -vv show origin</code> is looking better. A distinct
learning point for me is that it now reports that it&rsquo;s tracking - see
lines 5 and 6.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>* remote origin
  Fetch URL: https://github.com/paulgibbs/behat-wordpress-extension
  Push  URL: https://github.com/paulgibbs/behat-wordpress-extension
  HEAD branch: master
  Remote branch:
    master tracked
  Local branches configured for 'git pull':
    master merges with remote master
  Local ref configured for 'git push': master pushes to master (up to
  date) 
</code></pre><p>Following a sneaky <code>git pull</code> everything in the tree is as it should be.
The pointers are all at the latest commit:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>*   f786359 - (HEAD -&gt; master, origin/master, origin/HEAD) Merge everything together. (3 hours ago) &lt;Richard Vodden&gt;

</code></pre><h2 id="recreating-it">Recreating it.</h2>
<p>I believe that I don&rsquo;t truly understand a problem unless I can re-create
it. My first attempt was to delete my local remote tracking branch with
<code>git branch -d -r origin/master</code>. This, however,
showed a much more easily diagnosed output from <code>git branch -a -vv</code>:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>* master                 eef78635 [origin/master: gone] Merge everything together
</code></pre><p>Similarly <code>git remote -vv show origin</code> implies that all will fix itself
from here following a simple <code>git pull</code>:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>* remote origin
  Fetch URL: https://github.com/paulgibbs/behat-wordpress-extension
  Push  URL: https://github.com/paulgibbs/behat-wordpress-extension
  HEAD branch: master
  Remote branch:
    master new (next fetch will store in remotes/origin)
  Local branches configured for 'git pull':
    master merges with remote master
  Local ref configured for 'git push':
    master pushes to master (up to date)
</code></pre><p>Next I tried <code>git remote set-branches origin dev</code> <code>dev</code> being another
brand I picked more or less at random from the remote. This looked a good
deal more promising, with <code> git remote -vv show origin</code> showing:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>* remote origin
  Fetch URL: https://github.com/paulgibbs/behat-wordpress-extension
  Push  URL: https://github.com/paulgibbs/behat-wordpress-extension
  HEAD branch: master
  Remote branch:
    refs/remotes/origin/dev stale (use 'git remote prune' to remove)
  Local branches configured for 'git pull':
    dev    merges with remote dev
    master merges with remote master
  Local ref configured for 'git push':
    master pushes to master (up to date)
</code></pre><p>No luck, however, as when I inspect with <code>git show-ref</code> I can see that
<code>origin/master</code> no longer exists. So right now I&rsquo;m stuck. If anyone has
any suggestions as to how to re-create the issue I came across - please do
share in the comments below.</p>
