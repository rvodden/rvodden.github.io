      <description>PySketcher is little library which I maintain which makes it simple (hopefully) to draw geometric images. It was originally written by Hans Petter Langtangen, who sadly passed away in 2016, and since 2019 I&amp;rsquo;ve been keeping it up to date and adding features.
Right now, PySketcher only supports absolute positioning of shapes. This means that you have to know exactly where you&amp;rsquo;d like the center of your circle to be and exactly what radius it should have.</description>
