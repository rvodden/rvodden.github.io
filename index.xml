Equally comfortable driving a DevOps transformation at a strategic level, or effecting hands on implementation; the depth and breadth of my DevOps capability is unique. I have a background in Infrastructure and Solution Architecture, and over 15 years I have built up an expertise in SDLC and build chain optimization. I am equally comfortably in hands on and architecture roles and bring a pragmatic approach to process improvement and optimization to any project or organisation.</description></item></channel></rss>
